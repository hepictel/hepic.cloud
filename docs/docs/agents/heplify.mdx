<summary>Heplify as a Sniffer</summary>

> Capture IPv4/v6 SIP/RTCP packets with secure TLS transport to **hepic.cloud**

<img style={{ maxWidth: "600px" }} src="https://i.imgur.com/72biA6Z.png" />

You can run heplify on any VoIP Host (ie. asterisk, freeswitch) to passively sniff, correlate and encapsulate SIP/RTCP packets.

The command below captures SIP/RTCP on all the interfaces available on the machine and send it over to **hepic.cloud** securely via TLS.

 replace the unit file `/lib/systemd/system/heplify.service` with the following unit file

```bash
[Unit]
Description=Captures packets from wire and sends them to Hepic
After=network.target

[Service]
Environment="HEP_ID=9999"
Environment="HEP_SERVER=HEP-ENDPOINT-Provided-on-Gigapipe-Portal"
Environment="HEP_PASSWORD=HEP-TOKEN-Provide-on-Gigapipe-Portal"
Environment="HEP_BUFFER_FILE=/root/HEP.dump"
Environment="HEP_LOG_LEVEL=info"
Environment="HEP_INTERFACE=any"
Environment="HEP_PORTRANGE=5060-6000"
Environment="HEP_PROM_STATS=0.0.0.0:8090"
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/heplify -hep-buffer-activate -hep-buffer-file $HEP_BUFFER_FILE -l $HEP_LOG_LEVEL -sl -hi $HEP_ID -i $HEP_INTERFACE -pr $HEP_PORTRANGE -hs $HEP_SERVER -nt tls -hp $HEP_PASSWORD -t af_packets -tcpsendretries 0 -tcpassembly -prometheus $HEP_PROM_STATS
ExecStop=/bin/kill ${MAINPID}
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=10s
Type=simple

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
  
> Replace the **Envoirnmnet Variables** as per your systems settings. While
> Replace **HEP_SERVER** with `HEP Endpoint` and **HEP_PASSWORD** with `HEP Token` provided in data ingestion tab.

Start heplify
    
```bash
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl start heplify
```  
   
 It is best practice to specify a unique ID for each heplify instance, as this will allow engineers to identify the source of the captured call. The id specified in the above example via the -hi option is an integer within the range of 1-68520.

> When using tcp transports heplify may batch multiple sniffed messages into one. To avoid this we recommend using the `-sipassembly true` option to have heplify parse messages to correctly separate them

You are now ready to use heplify as a secure capture agent for any SIP/RTCP traffic on your host or network port spans.

<summary>Heplify as a Relay/Collector</summary>

> Ingest insecure **HEP UDP/TCP** packets and relay with secure **TLS** transport to **hepic.cloud**

<img style={{ maxWidth: "600px" }} src="https://i.imgur.com/ZV0tUmT.png" />

You can run heplify as a `HEP Collector` service to ingest insecure HEP traffic from existing HEP Agents _(ie: replacing a HOMER endpoint)_

The example below starts heplify in **collector** mode listening for **HEP traffic** on `TCP port 9061` and forwarding to **hepic.cloud.**

 replace the unit file `/lib/systemd/system/heplify.service` with the following unit file **(Heplify version must greater or equal 1.65.14)**

 ```bash
[Unit]
Description=Captures packets from wire and sends them to Hepic
After=network.target

[Service]
Environment="HEP_SERVER=HEP-ENDPOINT-Provided-on-Gigapipe-Portal"
Environment="HEP_PASSWORD=HEP-TOKEN-Provide-on-Gigapipe-Portal"
Environment="HEP_COLLECTOR=tcp:0.0.0.0:9061"
Environment="HEP_BUFFER_FILE=/root/HEP.dump"
Environment="HEP_LOG_LEVEL=info"
Environment="HEP_PROM_STATS=0.0.0.0:8090"
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/heplify -hep-buffer-activate -hep-buffer-file $HEP_BUFFER_FILE -l $HEP_LOG_LEVEL -sl -hin $HEP_COLLECTOR -hs $HEP_SERVER -hp $HEP_PASSWORD -nt tls -tcpsendretries 0 -tcpassembly -prometheus $HEP_PROM_STATS
ExecStop=/bin/kill ${MAINPID}
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=10s
Type=simple

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
  
> Replace the **Envoirnmnet Variables** as per your systems settings. While
> Replace **HEP_SERVER** with `HEP Endpoint` and **HEP_PASSWORD** with `HEP Token` provided in data ingestion tab.
  
Start heplify service with the following commands
  
```bash
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl start heplify
```
 
 confirm heplify service status
 ```bash
 systemctl status heplify
 ```
 verify if heplify is listening of specified port which is `9061` as per this KB settings. 
 ```bash
 ss -nlp | grep 9061
 ```
 > tcp   LISTEN 0      4096                                            *:9061                   *:*     users:(("heplify",pid=776,fd=16))
 
Now the next step is to point all HEP Agents / rtpagents over `TCP` to this IP and Port (`9061`) so that heplify can further send `HEP` traffic securely to hepic.cloud through public networks. It is best practice to specify a unique ID for each HEP Agent / rtpagent, as this will allow engineers to identify the source of the captured call.

 
> You are now ready to use **heplify** as endpoint for any **HEP Agents** such as Kamailio, OpenSIPS, Freeswitch, Asterisk, Drachtio, RTP:Engine, RTPProxy and many more.
