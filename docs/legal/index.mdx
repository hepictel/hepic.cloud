# ⚖️ Gigapipe Terms

## General Services Agreement

This Terms of Service Agreement ("TOS") shall constitute a binding contractual agreement between HEPvest Holding BV ("Gigapipe"), and the subscriber of services ("Customer"). This TOS shall include the Terms of Service ("TOS"), Acceptable Use Policy ("AUP"), Service Level Agreement ("SLA"), and any applicable addendum. Customer agrees to be bound to all agreements in this TOS.

Note: Gigapipe reserves the right to supplement and/or amend, at any time, the terms and conditions of its TOS, including the TOS, AUP, SLA, and any applicable addendum. Gigapipe will notify its Customers through the Client Area of any changes affecting cancellation, payment of fees, or the SLA. It is the Customer’s responsibility to review Gigapipe’s policies on a frequent basis to ensure compliance because the TOS in place during your most current month applies, not the TOS which was in place when you registered. Changes requested by Customer to any of these agreements or to the TOS must be agreed to in writing by Gigapipe.

### Terms of Service Agreement ("TOS")

Customer agrees to the following Terms of Service, (“TOS”):

1. VPS/Cloud Hosting Services: During the term of this TOS, Gigapipe will provide certain virtual private server and cloud hosting services (the “VPS/Cloud Hosting Services”) to Customer as ordered by Customer and agreed to by the parties as part of the online Customer order process at https://www.gigapipe.com.

2. Consulting Services: Customer may engage Gigapipe to perform, and Gigapipe may agree to perform, certain consulting or other services on a monthly basis (“Consulting Services”) as agreed to by the parties in a statement of work (“SOW”) signed by both parties which shall be subject to the applicable terms and conditions of this TOS. As consideration for Consulting Services provided by Gigapipe, Customer will pay Gigapipe in the form and amount of payment and on the terms specified in the SOW.

3. Term and Termination: The initial term of this TOS shall be monthly, semi-annually, annually or for such other period of time ordered by Customer and agreed to by the parties as part of the online Customer sign-up process at https://www.gigapipe.com (the “Initial Term”). This TOS shall automatically renew for additional periods of time equal to the Initial Term in perpetuity subject to written cancellation by (a) Customer in accordance with this TOS and (b) Gigapipe upon providing Customer with notice of non-renewal at least ten (10) days prior to the expiration of the Initial Term or any renewal term. Please carefully review Gigapipe’s cancellation policy set forth in Paragraph 10 below. Gigapipe may terminate this TOS and any related services (1) immediately (a) upon nonpayment as set forth in paragraph 12 below, (b) if Customer violates paragraph 16 (Permitted Use) of the TOS, or (c) if Customer violates any terms and conditions of the AUP or (2) upon any other breach of this TOS that is not cured upon Customer receiving written notice.

4. VPS/Cloud Hosting Service Fees: Fees for VPS/Cloud Hosting Services ordered by the Customer shall begin on the date of the initial order and that date shall serve as the applicable monthly, semi-annual, annual or other anniversary date based on the billing cycle ordered by Customer (“Anniversary Billing Date”) for all future billings including upgrades, additional services, cancellations and SLA Credits, as defined below. Fees are due in advance of the monthly, semi-annual, annual or other applicable service and billing cycle and will be billed on each Anniversary Billing Date.

5. Upgrade Fees: Upgrades to the VPS/Cloud Hosting Services ordered on the Anniversary Billing Date will be billed for a full month, six (6) months, or year based on the service and billing cycle ordered by Customer and will continue on the Anniversary Billing Date. Upgrades ordered after the normal Anniversary Billing Date will be pro-rated to the next Anniversary Billing Date and billed as a one time pro-rata charge.

6. Hourly Service Fees: For any services agreed to by the parties in writing and provided by Gigapipe on an hourly basis (“Hourly Services”), Customer shall specify the period of time for which the Hourly Services are requested, or cancel at any time. The minimum period of time for which Hourly Services may be requested is one (“1”) hour and Customer will be billed in full hourly increments, and no breakdown by minutes shall be permitted. Unless otherwise specifically stated in the TOS, Customers who request Hourly Services agree to all terms and conditions in Gigapipe’s TOS, including but not limited to these TOS and the AUP. Customers will be billed for Hourly Services and receive any SLA Credits, if applicable, on the Anniversary Billing Date (as set forth and defined in paragraph 4 above).

7. One Time Fees: One time fees, such as setup fees, administrative fees and late fees are due and payable at the time they are incurred, and/or agreed upon in writing or via ticket with Gigapipe’s written approval. One time fees, such as bandwidth overages, are due and payable upon delivery of an invoice following the billing cycle in which they are incurred, and are based on standard rates, or as otherwise agreed upon by the parties in writing or via ticket with Gigapipe’s approval.

8. Taxes: All prices and fees specified in or referred to in this TOS are stated exclusive of any tax, including withholding tax, sales, use, value added, levies, import and custom duties, excise or other similar or equivalent taxes imposed on the supply of services. Any taxes, sales, use, levies, excise, withholding taxes or similar charges, direct or indirect, applicable or to become applicable, which are levied as a result of the supply of the services shall be borne by the Customer. Neither party shall be liable for the other party’s taxes based on income. If withholding tax applies to any payments for services made under this TOS, the Customer may withhold that element that is required under the applicable legislation but must pay an additional amount to ensure that the full value of the invoice is remitted and must notify Gigapipe prior to payment that withholding tax is required to be paid. The parties undertake to cooperate, where possible, to minimize the amount of withholding tax due by making advance clearance applications under the relevant double taxation treaties (where applicable) to the relevant tax authority to reduce the rate of withholding tax or exempt entirely this amount if applicable. In any event, the Customer undertakes to account for any tax withheld to the tax authorities on a timely basis.

9. Service Level Agreement Credit(s), “SLA Credit(s)”: SLA Credits are governed by these TOS and the SLA Agreement, below. SLA Credits are a service credit that, when applicable, and following an SLA Credit claim, will be issued to your Customer account and may be used to offset future billable services. SLA Credits shall not be issued as cash back to the Customer nor shall the SLA Credits be transferable to other account holders. SLA Credits shall expire when Customer’s account is fully terminated.

10. Cancellation: Because cancellation is automated, Gigapipe requires a written cancellation notice via the Client Area, a minimum of twenty-four (“24”) hours prior to 00:00:01 PST (GMT-8) on the Anniversary Billing Date for discontinuance or downgrades of month-to-month services, unless specified otherwise. Failure to supply the requisite twenty-four (“24”) hours written notice of cancellation will result in a full billable cycle, on all service packages, prior to cancellation. Any server cancellation prior to the minimum deadline will remain online until the automated process reclaims your server on the Anniversary Billing Date.

The Gigapipe Credit shall not be issued as cash back to the Customer nor shall the Gigapipe Credit be transferable to other account holders. These credits shall be maintained in the Customer’s account and be used solely for the purchase of eligible products and/or services. Once used, the Gigapipe Credit(s) are extinguished and are not eligible for further application. Gigapipe Credits shall expire when Customer’s account is fully terminated.

13. Credits and Discounts Reversals: Should the Customer purchase products and/or services with their Gigapipe Credit and later, following the 14 Day Refund Window, wish to cancel those services, any Gigapipe Credit utilized in that purchase shall not be eligible for reuse. Further, if Gigapipe Credits or any other package discount was offered as an incentive for the entering into of a service agreement, and the associated agreement is canceled by the Customer prior to the end of the billing cycle, any Gigapipe Credits will be removed from that Customer’s account and the discounts applied to that agreement will be reversed or recalculated accordingly.

# Service Level Agreement (“SLA”)

The Service Level Agreement, “SLA” is incorporated into the TOS and applicable to all services delivered directly to Customers of Gigapipe. The SLA is not applicable to unrelated third parties or third parties lacking privity of contract with Gigapipe. The uptime guarantees and the resulting SLA Credit(s) are applied in monthly terms unless specified otherwise. To ensure that Gigapipe is providing optimal services to its Customers, Gigapipe is required to perform scheduled maintenance, from time to time, on the network, client area, and hardware. Any downtime resulting from any such scheduled maintenance or any event of Force Majeure does not qualify for SLA Credit(s). All SLA guarantees and information listed below are made in good faith and are subject to standard contract remedies. Note: SLA Credits for Hourly Services will be calculated and applied based on the same monthly calculation used for the month-to-month contracts.

1. SLA Credit Claim
To properly claim an SLA Credit due, the Customer’s master administrative user must open an SLA ticket with the Billing Department located inside the Client Area at https://www,gigapipe.com/manage within seven (“7”) days of the purported outage. Customer must include service type, IP Address, contact information, and full description of the service interruption including logs, if applicable. The SLA claim will be researched by the appropriate Gigapipe department manager and any credit issued will be issued to accounting and the ticket will be updated. SLA Credits are issued as service credits on future billing cycles. SLA Credits shall not be bartered or traded with other Gigapipe customers. Please allow up to fourteen (“14”) days for the process of SLA claims. Customer acknowledges that the maximum amount of SLA Credit that may be used for any particular month cannot exceed the total monthly service fee amount for such month.

Customers currently in arrears for monthly services do not qualify for SLA claims. Customers who have been in payment arrears three (“3”) or more times in the previous twelve (“12”) months do not qualify for SLA claims.

Any Customer making false or repetitive claims will incur a one-time charge of fifty dollars (“$50”) per incident for such claims.

Customers participating in malicious or aggressive Internet activities, thereby causing attacks or counter-attacks, do not qualify for SLA claims and shall be deemed in violation of the AUP.

Except for service downtimes resulting from Customer’s fault, and provided Customer follows the proper procedures for service credit claims as set forth in this SLA, for each continuous, uninterrupted thirty (“30”) minute interval of Public Network service downtime that Customer experiences during an applicable month, Gigapipe agrees to grant to Customer a SLA Credit equal to five percent (“5%”) of the Customer’s monthly service fees for that month. Public Network service downtimes of less than thirty (“30”) continuous, uninterrupted minutes do not qualify for this service credit, and the Customer cannot combine or augment Public Network or other service-related downtimes to satisfy such downtime requirement. All Public Network services include redundant carrier grade internet backbone connections.

5. Redundant Infrastructure
Gigapipe guarantees one hundred percent (“100%”) uptime on the power and HVAC services to Customers located in Data Center, subject to the provisions of this SLA.
