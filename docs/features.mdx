## Features

##### ⏱️ Accelerate Monitoring & Troubleshooting
Our perpetual capture systems makes investigating issues on complex networks an easier task by helping identify users and systems, reporting on usage, monitoring devices and correlating protocols and logs without impacting live services.

##### 🔇 Enforce Privacy-Friendly Media QoS
Our dedicated RTP Agent can capture, correlate and mirror media streams and emit real-time granular media analytics at custom frequency, complete with Jitter/RTT/Loss/Skew metrics, producing a reliable MOS/R-Factor at a fraction of resource costs.

##### 🕸️ Unify Distributed Architectures
Our core allows Engineers to consistently see the "big picture" by supporting swarms of HEP agents, native or dedicated, to be paired to any running instance in the monitored stack as it grows and shrinks, pairing with its deployment and cost model.

##### 🔒 Reduce Troubleshooting Risk and Security Breaches
Our suite of tightly integrated tools is designed for perpetual passive monitoring, optimised to quickly drive end-to-end session analysis investigations, reducing the need for remote engineering access and tools on service critical systems.

##### 📊 Perform Network & Business Analytics
The integrated HSP engine can group and aggregate passively obtained metrics into statistic branches defining network elements customer groups and their relations over time, providing a completely dynamic ground for alerts and anomaly detection.

##### 🔌 Integrate with 3rd party products
HEPIC can transparently provide advanced RTC monitoring and real-time tracking functionality, actiong as a vendor agnostic API in front of any platform, and with its native partitioning support can allow operators to offer self-troubleshooting tools.

## Strenghts

##### 💎 Open Integrations

Our stack is natively integrated with dozens of VoIP and WebRTC OSS Projects and Vendors. <br/>
Our core protocols and integrations are all developed by qxip and _completely opensource_.

##### ⚡ Performance

Our stack uses **ClickHouse** + **DuckDB** OLAP engines or fast ingestion, analytics & performance. <br/>
We develop our data engines and database extensions standing on the shoulders of giants.

##### 🍖 Underdog-ness

Our pricing model is different because we are different - and so are our amazing dedicated hosting and VPS partners. <br/>
We don't run on AWS. We are not VC controlled. Our products are made in EU - by humans for humans.
